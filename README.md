Current machine learning-based solutions to model protein-ligand interactions lack the level of
interpretability that physics-based methods usually provide. Here, a workflow to embed protein
binding surfaces as graphs was developed to serve as a viable data structure to be processed by
geometric deep learning. The developed architecture based on mixture density models was
employed to accurately estimate the position and conformation of the small molecule within
the binding region. The likelihood-based scoring function was compared against existing
physics-based alternatives, and significant performance improvements in terms of docking
power, screening power and reverse screening power were observed. Taken together, the
developed framework provides a platform for utilising geometric deep-learning models for
interpretable prediction of protein-ligand interactions at a residue level.
